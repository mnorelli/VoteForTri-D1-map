For anyone finding this in the future, I slayed my maddening problems with queryRenderedFeatures not giving results from outside the map view with TileSets API.  

1. load data to MapBox Studio as a custom TileSet
https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/
2. get the TileSet ID
3. use the MapBox JS SDK to implement a TileQuery
https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-js/blob/master/docs/services.md
and
https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-js
4.  test out a TileQuery API call with the Tilequery API Playground using the custom TileSet ID
https://docs.mapbox.com/playground/tilequery/

Thanks, Gregor, for leaving this breadcrumb trail that led to revelation!
